#SplitVentilatorMonitoring

Covid-19 Response - Monitors patients airflow connected to a split ventilator

When splitting ventilators so that a large group of patients can use one respirator, the problem arises that we can only use the ventilators Pressure control setting to ensure that all patients receive the same amount of pressure.

See https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/split-ventilators/ for more details on this subject.

So we have to set the ventilator to Volume control, which will not distribute the flow evenly to the patients.

This device will monitor the flow going to each patient so that the flow information can be displayed and alerts can be set based on this information.
